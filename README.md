## About the Project

Nordheim is a premium backpack brand that blends Scandinavian minimalism with functionality, offering high-quality backpacks for both urban and outdoor lifestyles. This project was built as a **full-stack e-commerce platform**, focusing on performance, usability, and a seamless shopping experience.

The goal was to create a high-end, visually refined online store, where every detail— from the user interface to the database structure— was carefully crafted to ensure efficiency and scalability.

Through this project, I have explored best practices in frontend development, designing a scalable data structure, optimizing workflows, and manually optimizing images to improve loading performance. This project challenged me to refine my frontend skills while integrating backend services, authentication, and state management, delivering a polished and functional product.
